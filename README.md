Next.js offers some serious performance improvements over the standard React web application. Here we will be using Next.js for:


- [Routing Pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)
- [Data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching)
- [Typescript Support](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript)

Here are the different sections / steps to make this project.

For more detailled information see: [Strongly Typed Next.js Book](https://michaelstromer.nyc/books/strongly-typed-next-js/introduction)

## Section 1: Next.js

1. Create a Next.js web application with TypeScript
2. Include custom fonts and styles in our web app
3. Link pages using Next.js routing

- app/pages/index.tsx: homepage for our website.
- app/pages/about.tsx: page about.
- app/pages/_app.tsx: handles global page props.
- app/pages/_document.tsx: handles global styles.
- app/lib/theme.ts: custom light/dark modes theme.

## Section 2: TypeGraphQL

1. Create a GraphQL API schema with TypeGraphQL
2. Create a UserResolver for fetching user data

- api/entity/Stream.ts: embedded posts.
- api/entity/User.ts: database schema.
- api/middleware/isAuth.ts: make sure the current session contains a logged in user.
- api/middleware/typegoose.ts: convert MongoDB Documents into readable objects.
- api/schema/object-id.scalar.ts: ObjectId scalar for our schema.
- api/types/Ref.ts: manual reference.
- api/types/MyContext.ts: used to infer the current user's session.
- api/resolvers/UserResolver.ts: used to infer the current user's session.

In order to design a relational database, we need to understand the connections between our models. Let's define an **Entity** Relationship Diagram, or ERD for our models:

![entity](_readme-img/model-entities.png)

A **document schema** is a JSON object that allows you to define the shape and content of documents and embedded documents in a collection. You can use a schema to require a specific set of fields, configure the content of a field, or to validate changes to a document based on its beginning and ending states.

**Models** are fancy constructors compiled from Schema definitions. An instance of a model is called a **document**. Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database.

**Method Decorator**: A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated class.

**Ref Type**: A Ref is considered to be a manual reference. A manual references is where you save the ObjectId field of one document in another document as a reference. Then your application can run a second query to return the related data.

**Streams**: Streams are considered to be embedded posts. We reference the User entity with our Ref type, and assign them as the stream's author.

The **GraphQLScalarType** code handles parsing objects as strings, and serializing them as hex strings. This is useful for converting ObjectId properties into string values.

In summary ObjectID("adaj130jfsdm10") becomes a text string: adaj130jfsdm10, and vice versa.

**Typegoose Middleware**: we convert MongoDB Documents into readable objects. Without this middleware, our Ref types would not be able to reference other database objects.

A **resolver** is a function that's responsible for populating the data for a single field in your schema. Whenever a client queries for a particular field, the resolver for that field fetches the requested data from the appropriate data source.

A resolver function returns one of the following:

- Data of the type required by the resolver's corresponding schema field (string, integer, object, etc.)
- A promise that fulfills with data of the required type

## Section 3: Typegoose

1. Create authentication and stream resolvers
2. Create password manager for authentication

![db](_readme-img/db.png)

Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks, and even Typescript.

Take Mongoose, add TypGraphQL and you get Typegoose. Typegoose is a wrapper library for easily writing MongoDB models with TypeScript. It allows us to easily apply Mongoose schemas and models in TypeScript.

Typegoose will create the correct schemas and model mappings for our database. In getting started, it is important to realize that the decision to use Typegoose is based on using MongoDB. Given another database driver, you may want to consider using an Object Relational Mapping like TypeORM.

- api/types/AuthInput.ts: input type to handle sending the data values (email + pw)
- api/types/UserResponse.ts: returns a User object and JWT string
- api/types/StreamInput.ts: stream with inputs for user
- api/resolvers/AuthResolver.ts: Given an email address, check if a user already exists.
If not, create a new user with a hashed password value
Finally, assign and return the new user's JSON Web Token.
- api/resolvers/StreamResolver.ts: we can query for single and multiple streams. We can create new streams, given a user is logged in and has a valid session userId.


**Mutation queries** modify data in the data store and returns a value. It can be used to insert, update, or delete data. Mutations are defined as a part of the schema.

**`Partial<Type>`** Not all the of properties `<Type>` are required. (>< `Required<Type`>).

## Section 4: Apollo Server

1. Create a GraphQL API server with Apollo Server Express
2. Create a MongoDB database connection with Connect Mongo
3. Create environment variables for your localhost server

Note: database cluster is hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
The application uses **Serverless architecture** (also known as serverless computing or function as a service, FaaS) is a software design pattern where applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the need for server software and hardware management by the developer. Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually.

**Apollo Server Express** allows us to build a GraphQL query interface on top of an existing Express server.

- api/schema/index.ts: Add all typescript resolvers into the schema from the ../resolvers directory.
Apply typegoose middleware to allow GraphQL work with MongoDB Documents.
Apply the scalars map to parse ObjectId properties into string values.
- api/server: Apollo Server Express runs the server
- api/server/env.ts: Using the dotenv library, we are able to determine if a valid .env file is present and log all it's respective values.
- api/server/index.ts: ApolloServer is initialized with an Express server.
- api/session: Mongoose creates the server sessions
-  api/session/index.ts: we initialize a MongoDB connection. If any errors are thrown, they will be handled by the server at runtime.

## Section 5: Apollo Client

1. Create an Apollo Client instance on the frontend web
2. Generate queries and mutations with GraphQL codegen

The most efficient use of Typescript and GraphQL is generating frontend queries, using the **GraphQL Codegen** library.

Using GraphQL Codegen, we generate queries and mutations for the frontend client.

- app/.graphql-let.yml: file to configure GraphQL Codegen behavior.
- app/next-env.d.ts: global properties for the Next project (allows TS to read YML files)
- app/next.config.js: webpack config
- app/lib/graphql/currentUser.graphql: query - Every query needs a name, so we called this one CurrentUser.
- app/lib/graphql/stream.graphql: query -  this query requires an input called streamId. We will use it to fetch individual streams
- app/lib/graphql/streams.graphql: query - this query fetches the current user's streams, so they will need to be logged in.
- app/lib/graphql/createStream.graphql: mutation - Note that this mutation has an input value of StreamInput, which is required.
- app/lib/graphql/editStream.graphql: mutation
- app/lib/graphql/deleteStream.graphql: mutation
- app/lib/graphql/signin.graphql: mutation
- app/lib/graphql/signup.graphql: mutation
- app/lib/apollo.ts: we connect to the Apollo Client with an HttpLink. During initialization, we also need to include credentials in order to support GraphQL authentication. On any Next.js page that uses data fetching methods, we can re-hydrate the Apollo client cache and fetch data from the cache instead of the server. The useApollo hook will handle initializing and caching once its integrated with a root component, like _app.tsx.
- app/pages/_app.tsx: apollo intergration

Generate the queries and mutations type definition files with graphql-let.:

`cd app`

`npx graphql-let`

````bash
âœ” Parse configuration
[ graphql-let ] 8 .d.ts were generated.
````

Files are generated in: *app/lib/graphql/*

### Local API schema

**app/.graphql-let.yml**

````yml
schema: 'lib/schema.graphqls'
documents: '**/*.graphql'
plugins:
  - typescript
  - typescript-operations
  - typescript-react-apollo
cacheDir: __generated__
````

Grab a copy of the GraphQL schema by copying the entire file *api/schema/schema.gql* and pasting it's contents inside a new file called *app/lib/schema.graphqls*.

## Section 6: Authentication

1. Create components and pages to handle data fetching
2. Create an authentication flow for login and registration

- app/lib/useAuth.tsx: Auth Provider - The purpose of the AuthProvider is to create a global user object, and handle any authentication logic with a single hook. Once we declare the AuthProvider, you may notice that authentication becomes much quicker to implement.
- app/pages/_app.tsx: The useAuth.tsx code snippet creates a global auth context called AuthContext, but to access it's props we need to wrap the root app/pages/_app.tsx to access the global user object using the useAuth hook.
- app/components/Header.tsx: header with sign in/up, dark mode toggle
- app/pages/auth/signin.tsx: used in header
- app/pages/auth/signup.tsx: used in header
- app/pages/auth/signout.tsx: used in header
